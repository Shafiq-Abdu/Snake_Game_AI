# Teaching AI To Play Snake! Reinforcement Learning With PyTorch and Pygame

In this Python Reinforcement Learning Project - Made AI to play Snake! Build everything from scratch using Pygame and PyTorch. 

High thanks to the tutorials : [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqnslRFeH2UrDh7vUmJ60YrmWd64mTTKV)

- Part 1: I'll show you the project and teach you some basics about Reinforcement Learning and Deep Q Learning.
- Part 2: Learn how to setup the environment and implement the Snake game.
- Part 3: Implement the agent that controls the game.
- Part 4: Implement the neural network to predict the moves and train it.


Steps.
 - game_ab.py --> agent_ab.py <-- model_ab.py
 - Run snake_game_human.py first.
 - Run agent.py to make ai to play.
 - Watch training video to say, Wow! if you are new to Ml or just say , What the Hell it is , and move on!
